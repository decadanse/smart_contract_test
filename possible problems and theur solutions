> Something went wrong while attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.

Could not connect to your Ethereum client with the following parameters:
    - host       > 127.0.0.1
    - port       > 7545
    - network_id > 5777
Please check that your Ethereum client:
    - is running
    - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., "--rpc" option is used in geth)
    - is accessible over the network
    - is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle-config.js)

Ah, you need to nest the development field in your config within a networks object.

module.exports = {
  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>
  // to customize your Truffle configuration!
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      port: 23889,
      network_id: '*', // eslint-disable-line camelcase
      from: '0x7926223070547d2d15b2ef5e7383e541c338ffe9',
      gasPrice: '0x64', 
    }
  }
};

if config file we have 
"  networks: {
    development: {"

so we need 
$ truffle development

In your migration file, you have to do something like this, at the end of the deployment, you can add the arguments that the constructor needs.

const MSWallet = artifacts.require("MSWallet");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MSWallet, ["address1","address2","address3"], 2);
};

Your constructor requires an array and uint values to initialize, so im just sending it an array with addresses and the approvals limit.

    constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint _approvalLimit) {
        owners = _owners;
        approvalLimit = _approvalLimit;
    }
